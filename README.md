# Discord Trivia Bot - WARNING: Not currently ready for public use

Discord Trivia Bot is an app used to run trivia through a discord bot.
The application is made of three pieces, a UI to upload trivia through, an API to store and retrieve trivia from a Postgres database, and Javascript to run the discord bots.

## Installation

Instructions on how to set up each piece of the project can be found in a separate Readme for each piece in each subfolder.


## Where To Get The Trivia

Currently this project is specifically set up to handle and parse trivia from [Trivia Mafia](https://www.patreon.com/m/4171258/posts). They typically put out two full sets of trivia per week to their Patreon subscribers. <br>

## Future plans

I'd be open to expanding the project to work with trivia from other sources if there is interest. Feel free to reach out to me if this is something you'd be interested in.
